Renting a photo booth for an event in Raleigh, NC, can be a delightful addition, providing guests with both entertainment and memorable keepsakes. The cost to rent a photo booth in Raleigh varies depending on several factors. Here's a breakdown to help guide your decision:

1. **Type of Photo Booth**: 
    - **Traditional Booths**: These are the classic enclosed booths that many people remember from malls and arcades. They typically range from $500-$700 for a few hours of rental.
    - **Open Air Booths**: More modern and accommodating for larger groups, open air booths might be slightly more expensive, ranging from $600-$800 for similar hours.
    - **Digital Booths**: Often incorporating features like GIFs, Boomerangs, and digital props, these can range from $700-$900.

2. **Duration of Rental**: Most companies provide packages based on the number of hours you rent the booth. While a three-hour rental might cost $600, a full day could be upwards of $1,200.

3. **Additional Features and Customizations**:
    - **Props**: Some companies provide props for an added cost, while others include it in the package.
    - **Custom Backdrops**: Depending on the design and material, it might add $50-$200 to your total cost.
    - **Photo Album/Scrapbook**: This could be an additional $50-$100.
    - **Digital Copies**: While some companies provide a digital gallery for free, others might charge for this service.

4. **Travel and Setup Fees**: Some companies within Raleigh might not charge for travel, but if they're coming from outside the city or if your venue is harder to access, you might incur additional costs.

5. **Date of Event**: Just like wedding venues or caterers, the cost to rent a photo booth might increase during peak seasons or on weekends.

6. **Quality and Reputation of the Company**: Established companies with a history of reliable service and high-quality equipment might charge more than newer, less proven entities.

**Things to Consider**:
- Always read reviews or get referrals before choosing a company.
- Check if there are any hidden fees or additional costs that might arise.
- Determine beforehand if you need any additional hours or features, as adding them on the day of the event might be more expensive.

In conclusion, while the base cost to rent a photo booth in Raleigh, NC might start as low as $500, with additional features, customizations, and other factors, it could easily approach $1,000 or more. It's always best to clarify details and costs upfront to ensure your event goes off without a hitch.
